about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
Technological advances have always attracted my interest due to all the possibilities given to the general population. This liking has evolved over the years, especially in the computer science field.

As a researcher at IST and last year student at Univ. of Minho, my formation was marked by fields with a strong presence at the present time, like Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

The use of a miscellaneous of Machine Learning techniques applied to a variety of case studies, the development of intelligent systems and the use of ambient sensing were part of my path. Furthermore, I had contact with knowledge extraction methodologies with data from different sources as well as the use of Big Data tools.

Allied to the studies, I always involved myself in extra-curricular activities, particularly in sports, with the practice of football and kickboxing; and also in music, playing as a percussionist at Banda Filarmónica de Revelhe (philarmonic band).
